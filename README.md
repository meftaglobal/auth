# reacting-auth

This project showcases a highly efficient Role-Based Access Control (RBAC) system, built with the latest architecture and tools including Gin, Casbin, JWT, microservices, Kubernetes, Etcd, NATS, and microfrontends with React.

The RBAC system ensures secure and scalable management of user roles and permissions. With Gin's powerful routing capabilities and Casbin's flexible access control library, the project delivers efficient authorization management.

Using microservices architecture enables modular development and independent deployment of components. Kubernetes ensures reliable container orchestration, while Etcd serves as a distributed key-value store for configuration management. NATS enables fast and efficient communication between microservices.

The incorporation of microfrontends with React allows for flexible and seamless frontend development, enhancing user experiences.

In summary, this project demonstrates a robust and modern approach to RBAC, leveraging top-notch architecture and tools for efficient access control and scalability.
